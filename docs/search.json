R bash /site end point provides interactive site containing charts, without child data. end point primarily useful obtain quick overview available charts. R bash /site/request end point creates URL personalised, interactive site containing charts. Run command paste generated URL address field browser. starting chart chosen JAMES depends age child. systems, command may fail browser error [400] connect server [localhost]. alternative break request two steps. First, create session uploading child data, use session create URL personalised site. start uploading data JAMES het r$session. , can use either site\\request manual construction URL site: Paste generated URL address field browser. initial page shown depends child’s age. two-step approach also works remote servers. practice, use two-step approach stabler reliable. R bash /blend/request end point returns results multiple end points, thus functions one-stop shop. However, currently support graphics output, use /{session}/{info}/svglite /charts/draw/svglite charts. two-step approach : Note: example requires OpenCPU library access may work ACC
