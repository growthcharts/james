\title{Applies the adaptive test algorithm to determine the next step: administer
the next item or stop test and return D-score.}
\usage{
dcat(
  txt = "",
  instrument = "gs1",
  key = "gsed2510",
  population = NULL,
  p = 50,
  sem_rule = 1.726,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{txt}{A JSON string, URL, or file with BDS data in JSON format. Data
should conform to the BDS JGZ 3.2.5 specification.}

\item{instrument}{A character vector with 3-position codes of instruments
that should match. The default is \code{instrument = "gs1"} for GSED SF;
\code{instrument = NULL} allows for all instruments.}

\item{key}{String. They key identifies 1) the difficulty estimates
pertaining to a particular Rasch model, and 2) the prior mean and standard
deviation of the prior distribution for calculating the D-score.
The default key \code{key = "gsed2510"}.}

\item{population}{String. Name of the reference population.}

\item{p}{percentage to pass the item, difficulty in percentile units.}

\item{sem_rule}{numeric target for sem can be estimated based on Cohen's d
from \code{sem_rule()}.}

\item{session}{Optional session key if data is already uploaded to \code{sitehost}.}

\item{format}{JSON schema version, e.g., \code{"3.0"}. Used when uploading.}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
A string with an item name or a table.
