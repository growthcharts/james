\description{
Server-side function cto construct a URL to a site that shows a personalised
growth chart. The site includes a navigation bar so that the end
user can tweak chart choice.
}
\details{
The function can take child data in two forms: 1) a JSON file with
BDS-formatted child data (argument \code{txt}) or, 2) a URL with
child data on a previously stored server location on the server
(argument \code{loc}).

One of \code{txt} or \code{loc} need to be specified. If both are given,
\code{txt} takes precedence.
}
\note{
The \code{txt} option uploads and processes the data on the host where
this code runs.
