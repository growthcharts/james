\usage{
request_site(
  txt = "",
  session = "",
  loc = "",
  format = "1.0",
  upload = TRUE,
  host = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{txt}{A JSON string, URL or file with the data in JSON
format. The input data adhere to specification
\href{https://www.ncj.nl/themadossiers/informatisering/basisdataset/documentatie/?cat=12}{BDS JGZ 3.2.5},
and are converted to JSON according to \code{schema}.}

\item{session}{Alternative to \code{txt}. Session key where input data is uploaded.}

\item{loc}{Alternative to \code{txt}. Location where input data is uploaded.}

\item{format}{String. JSON data schema version number. There are currently
three schemas supported: \code{"1.0"}, \code{"1.1"} and \code{"2.0"}. Formats \code{"1.0"} and
\code{"1.1"} are included for backward compatibility only. Use \code{format = "2.0"}
for new applications.}

\item{upload}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then \code{request_site()} will upload
the data in \code{txt} and return a site address with the \verb{?loc=} query appended.
Setting (\code{FALSE}) just appends \verb{?txt=} to the site url, thus
deferring validation and conversion to internal representation to the site.}

\item{host}{URL of the JAMES server. By default, host is the currently
running server that processes the request.}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
URL composed of JAMES server, possibly appended by query string starting
with \verb{?txt=} or \verb{?loc=}.
}
\description{
Server-side function to construct a URL to a site that shows a personalised
growth chart. The site includes a navigation bar so that the end
user can interact to chart choices.
}
\details{
One of \code{txt} or \code{loc} needs to be specified. If both are given,
\code{txt} takes precedence. If neither is given, then the function returns
the base site without any data.
}
\note{
This function does not yet work with Docker because we cannot get the
host URL name.
The output form \verb{?txt=} currently ignores the \code{schema} argument.
}
\examples{
fn <- system.file("testdata", "client3.json", package = "james")
js <- jsonlite::toJSON(jsonlite::fromJSON(fn), auto_unbox = TRUE)
url <- "https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/testdata/client3.json"
host <- "http://localhost"

# solutions that upload the data and create a URL with the `?loc=` query parameter
\dontrun{
# upload file - works with docker on localhost
site <- request_site(fn, host = host)
# browseURL(site)

# upload JSON string
site <- request_site(js, host = host)
site
# browseURL(site)

# upload URL
site <- request_site(url, host = host)
site
# browseURL(site)

# same, but in two steps, starting from file name
# this also works for js and url
resp <- jamesclient::upload_txt(fn, host = host)
loc <- jamesclient::get_url(resp, "location")
site <- request_site(loc = loc)
site
# browseURL(site)

# solutions that create an immediate ?txt=[..data..] query
# this method does not create a cache on the server
site <- request_site(fn, upload = FALSE)
site <- request_site(js, upload = FALSE)
site <- request_site(url, upload = FALSE)
# browseURL(site)
}
