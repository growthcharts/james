## Joint Anthropometric Measurement and Evaluation System (JAMES)

JAMES is an experimental web service for creating and interpreting charts of child growth and
development. The current version

1. provides access to high-quality growth charts used by the Dutch youth health care;
2. interchanges data coded according to the [Basisdataset JGZ](https://www.ncj.nl/themadossiers/informatisering/basisdataset/documentatie/?cat=13);
3. screens for abnormal height, weight and head circumference;
4. converts developmental data into the D-score;
5. predicts future growth and development.

The service can be used by anyone interested in high-quality charts for
monitoring and evaluating childhood growth. This document highlights some
applications of JAMES, and provides pointers to relevant background
information.

## Check whether JAMES is running

JAMES is currently located at url `groeidiagrammen.nl`. The sections below use
`curl` for illustration, but any `HTTP` client will work.

In order to check whether the JAMES server is running, try generating some
random numbers by calling `stats::rnorm()`, in a terminal window as follows,

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/stats/R/rnorm/json --data n=5
```

The primary user functions cover out wide range of activities. Let us look into these in some more detail.

### Available growth charts

The site https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/ provides a quick round-trip of growth charts. JAMES currently offers 394 different charts, divided into three chart groups:

1. 140 charts for children of various ethnicities, age groups and outcomes [@talma2010];
2. 240 charts specifically designed for preterms [@bocca-tjeertes2012];
3. 14 charts based on the WHO Child Growth Standards [@who2006];

The `list_charts()` function in JAMES function produces a tabular overview of all charts. 

We may uses any HTTP client to download the list of growth charts. Many systems have the `curl` command already installed. We download the list into a JSON file by the following request:

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/R/list_charts/json -d "" -o ~/Downloads/jamescharts.json
```

A request to `list_charts` on JAMES will yield a response like

```{bash}
Response [https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/list_charts]
  Date: 2020-09-02 13:29
  Status: 201
  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
  Size: 248 B
/ocpu/tmp/x07c4471d08dbd3/R/.val
/ocpu/tmp/x07c4471d08dbd3/R/list_charts
/ocpu/tmp/x07c4471d08dbd3/stdout
/ocpu/tmp/x07c4471d08dbd3/source
/ocpu/tmp/x07c4471d08dbd3/console
/ocpu/tmp/x07c4471d08dbd3/info
/ocpu/tmp/x07c4471d08dbd3/files/DESCRIPTION
```

The status is 201 (Resources created), and the unique session `{key}` is `x07c4471d08dbd3`. Note that this changes with each request, so if you are replicating these commands, be sure to change `{key}` accordingly. Session keys and their url's remain valid for 24 hours. See https://www.opencpu.org/api.html for succinct documentation of the OpenCPU interface. 

Not all information that JAMES return is interesting. In this case, we would like to see the table of charts in JSON format. We may these obtain this table from the URL `https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x07c4471d08dbd3/R/.val/json`. The first entry looks like

```{json}
{
  "chartgrp": "nl2010",
  "chartcode": "HJAA",
  "population": "HS",
  "sex": "male",
  "design": "A",
  "side": "front",
  "language": "dutch",
  "week": ""
}
```

The central field is `chartcode`, which contains a unique 4-7 character code identifying the particular chart. In this example, code `HJAA` represents a chart for boys with Indo-Surinamese background (population `HS`) and design `A` (chart with head circumference, length and weight for boys aged 0-15 months). The codes are compatible and extend those used in @talma2010.

### Requesting a growth chart

We may download growth chart `HJAA` with the `draw_chart()` function as follows:

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/draw_chart -d "chartcode='HJAA'"
```

This produces the following output

```{bash}
/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/R/.val
/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/R/draw_chart
/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/graphics/1
/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/stdout
/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/source
/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/console
/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/info
/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/files/DESCRIPTION
```

View the chart in the browser by pasting the following into the url address field:

```{bash}
https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/graphics/1/svglite?width=8.27&height=11.69
```

or download the growth chart as 

```{bash}
curl -o mychart.svg 'https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x038e163dc6de71/graphics/1/svglite?width=8.27&height=11.69' -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0'
```

In order to obtain the right canvas size, the URL needs to be in quotes and the request needs `-H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0'` option added.

### Adding data to charts

Until now, we have only seen empty growth charts. This section describes various ways to add child data to the charts. 

#### Data format 

The [BDS JGZ 3.2.5](https://www.ncj.nl/themadossiers/informatisering/basisdataset/documentatie/?cat=12) protocol facilitates the exchange of data between parties active in the Dutch youth health care. The format is basically a codebook of variables. Each variable has a number: `bdsnummer`. JAMES adopts the format, and accepts data in JSON format according to a [JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefvanbuuren/minihealth/master/inst/json/bds_schema_str.json).

A minimal example of the data according to the schema is:

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/testdata/client3.json
```

Save the file [client3.json](https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/testdata/client3.json) on your local system by

```{bash eval=FALSE}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/testdata/client3.json -O
```

which produces a file called `client3.json` in your working directory.

For testing purposes, you may change its values, but please keep the general
structure intact.

#### Charting the child data, JSON file

The following `curl` command uploads and converts the file, and plots the data on a growth chart:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
curl -F 'txt=@client3.json' https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/draw_chart

/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/R/.val
/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/R/draw_chart
/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/graphics/1
/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/stdout
/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/source
/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/console
/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/info
/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/files/client3.json
/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/files/DESCRIPTION
```

As before, you can draw the chart by pasting the following URL in the browser:

```{bash}
https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x0f59c6526dba8a/graphics/1/svglite
```

JAMES automatically selected the length-by-age chart for preterm girls born at a gestational age of 27 weeks.

#### Charting the child data, JSON string

Send the child's data as a JSON string instead of a file provides some more flexibility. The following code assumes that utility `jq` is installed.

First, convert the JSON file into a JSON string, with double quotes (`"`) properly escaped.

```{bash}
var=$(jq '.' client3.json | jq -sR '.')
echo $var
```

Then run the following command requesting chart code `PMAAN27`:

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/draw_chart -d "txt=$var&chartcode='PMAAN27'&selector='chartcode'"
```

The results returns an URL pointing to an A4 formatted different chart for preterm girls with the points added.

There are many more options possible. See the help in:

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/man/draw_chart/text
```

### Data cache

JAMES takes the following general steps to plot data:

  1. The client sends a request that posts the child data;
  2. The server validates the input;
  3. The server transforms the data into JAMES internal format;
  4. The server adds the data points to the chart;
  5. The server sends a response to the client;
  6. The client interprets the response.
  
All JAMES functions support the complete set of actions through the `txt` parameter, as used above. In addition, many functions also accept the cached result from steps 1-3 as input through the `loc` parameter. More in particular, the `loc` method saves the result after step 3, and feeds the location of the converted data into a second request that applies the plotting. Both `txt` and `loc `methods yield the same result. 

The obvious advantage of caching is that validation has only to be done once. In cases where the user needs multiple analyses for the same child, for example for building an interactive site, caching may result in snappier behaviour. It may also be easier to diagnose errors in the input data. On the other hand, caching also requires some more work on the client side. The nature of the application determines which method works best. 

#### Example of data cache

An example, let's create a chart in two steps. We first upload the data using `fetch_loc`, which accepts JSON input and return the location with the uploaded data.

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/fetch_loc -d "txt=$var"

/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/R/.val
/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/R/fetch_loc
/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/stdout
/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/source
/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/console
/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/info
/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/files/DESCRIPTION
```

We create the chart by

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/draw_chart -d "loc='https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/'"
```

## Request a dedicated url to the chart site

The child's data can be plotted on any of the available charts using a *child
chart site*. We can construct a child's site by means of the following request.

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/request_site/json -d "txt=$var"
["https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/?loc=https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x0dde6c563edb40/"]
```

This command uploads and checks the input data, and appends the result URL to the site base URL. The combined URL starts a personalised site with the child's data.

Alternatively, if we already obtained a `loc` parameters (e.g. by using `fetch_loc`), we can combine that with the site base URL as follows.

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/request_site/json -d "loc='https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/'"
["https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/?loc=https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x02691745d874cc/"]
```


There are three ways to choose which chart is being plotted:

  1. JAMES picks a default chart; 
  2. The developer provides a `chartcode` parameter; 
  3. The end user manipulates the interactive controls.

Options 1 and 2 determine the first chart that is shown to the end user. 

#### Site with default chart

The default chart picked by JAMES is currently hard-wired as the child's height
chart that contains the most recent measurements. If the child is a pre-term
(gestational age <= 36 weeks) and younger than
4 years, then JAMES chooses the appropriate preterm chart.

The chart site with the default start can be started by combining the [uploaded
data](https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x06938035d05dac/) and the main site
at (https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/) as
```{bash}
curl "https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/?loc=https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x06938035d05dac/"
```

Pasting this url in your browser starts the site with the child's data.

### Site with developer-specified chart

Starting the site at a given growth chart is possible by specifying the
`chartcode` parameters. For example, we may initialize the site at chart
`PMAAN27` by

```{bash}
curl "https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/?loc=https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x06938035d05dac/&chartcode=PMAAN27"
```

The site now starts with `PMAAN27` instead of `PMAHN27`. Any chart can be
chosen. It is the responsability of the developer that the choice is sensible
given the child's data.

#### Site with user-specified chart

After the site is started the end user may change the chart on which the data
are drawn by simply using the site controls.

## Screen growth curves according to JGZ guidelines

  `screen_growth`    | Screen growth curves according to JGZ guidelines

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/screen_growth -d "txt=$var"
```

We obtain the screening results as

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x04fc43cfd709b7/R/.val/json
````

```

  }
]
```


## Create one request with list of return values

In some cases, we would like to bundle return values from a custom set of calls. That is the job of `custom_list`. The current version of `custom_list` will return a site URL (created by `request_site`), a table of screening results (created by `screen_growth`) and the last D-score (created by `calculate_dscore`). For example, the calls 

```{bash}
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/library/james/R/custom_list -d "txt=$var"
curl https://groeidiagrammen.nl//ocpu/tmp/x098464a29301fe/R/.val/json
```

return

```
{
  "UrlGroeicurven": "https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/lib/james/www/?loc=https://groeidiagrammen.nl/ocpu/tmp/x03ee2514b1b1d2/",
  "Resultaten": [
    {
      "Categorie": 1000,
      "CategorieOmschrijving": "Lengte",
      "Code": 1031,
      "CodeOmschrijving": "Het advies volgens de JGZ-richtlijn lengtegroei is als volgt: In principe geen verwijzing nodig, naar eigen inzicht handelen.",
      "Versie": "1.6.0",
      "Leeftijd0": "20181111",
      "Leeftijd1": "20181211"
    },
    {
      "Categorie": 2000,
      "CategorieOmschrijving": "Gewicht",
      "Code": 2031,
      "CodeOmschrijving": "Het advies volgens de JGZ-richtlijn overgewicht is als volgt: In principe geen verwijzing nodig, naar eigen inzicht handelen.",
      "Versie": "1.6.0",
      "Leeftijd0": "20181111",
      "Leeftijd1": "20181211"
    },
    {
      "Categorie": 3000,
      "CategorieOmschrijving": "Hoofdomtrek",
      "Code": 3031,
      "CodeOmschrijving": "In principe geen verwijzing nodig, naar eigen inzicht handelen.",
      "Versie": "1.6.0",
      "Leeftijd0": "20181111",
      "Leeftijd1": "20181211"
    }
  ]
}
```

which contains the return values generated by `request_site` (called "UrlGroeicurven" here) and by `screen_growth` (called "Resultaten" here). 
There no result for `calculate_dscore` because the data do not contain any developmental scores that would be needed to calculate a D-score.

In principle, `custom_list` provides an option for clients to bundle the results of multiple requests into one call. The current functionality, however, is limited to what is indicated in this section.

## Legacy functionality

This following table lists functions that are active in the current version, but that we will not further develop. Please replace them by the suggested alternative.

  |Function           | Description                                | Preferred alternative          |
  |------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
  |`convert_bds_ind`  | Validate, convert, store input (server)    | `fetch_loc`                    |
  |`upload_txt`       | Validate, convert, store input (client)    | `jamesclient::upload_txt`      |
  |`draw_chart_bds`   | Draw chart from uploaded                   | `draw_chart(txt = ...)`        |
  |`draw_chart_ind`   | Draw chart from cached data                | `draw_chart(loc = ...)`        |
  |`screen_curves`    | Screen growth along JGZ guidelines         | `screen_growth`, `custom_list` |

This following table lists argument names that are active in the current version, but that will be phased out for consistency.  Please replace them by the suggested alternative.

  |Argument           | Description                                | Preferred alternative          |
  |------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
  |`bds_data`         | JSON input data                            | `txt`                          | 
  |`ind_loc`          | Location with cached data.                 | `loc`                          |
  |`location`         | Location with cached data.                 | `loc`                          |
  |`?ind=`            | URL query parameter for cached data        | `?loc=`                        |

At some point these functions and argument names will be deprecated and removed.

## Next steps

Things that were still on the wish list in Sept 2019:

- transfer JAMES to url james.tno.nl [wait for docker version]
- allow for more input formats [NOW support for both `txt` and `loc`]
- add https protocol [DONE]
- add functionality to test for Dutch guidelines for referral [DONE, 3 guidelines]
- add functionality to predict individual growth curves [DONE]
- extend functionality to include the $D$-score charts [DONE]

## Architecture

The growth charts in JAMES are programmed in `R`. JAMES makes these available
through the [OpenCPU](https://www.opencpu.org) system for scientific computing
and reproducuble research. The system allows for easy integration of growth
charts into any `HTTP` compliant client by means of OpenCPU's
[API](https://www.opencpu.org/api.html). JAMES is a RESTful webservice.
