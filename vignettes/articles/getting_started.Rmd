## Overview

JAMES is a web service for creating and interpreting charts of child growth and development. The current version

1. provides access to high-quality growth charts used by the Dutch youth health care;
2. interchanges data coded according to the [Basisdataset JGZ 4.0.1](https://www.ncj.nl/onderwerp/digitaal-dossier-jgz/bds-jgz-versiebeheer/);
3. screens for abnormal height, weight and head circumference;
4. converts developmental data into the D-score;
5. predicts future growth and development.

JAMES is a RESTful API that runs on a remote host. The following sections illustrate how a client can make requests to JAMES using various client languages. In principle, any `HTTP` client will work with JAMES. The document highlights some applications of the service and provides pointers to relevant background information.

The service aids in monitoring and evaluating childhood growth. JAMES is created and maintained by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO. Please contact Stef van Buuren <stef.vanbuuren at tno.nl> for further information.

The table lists the defined API end points and the mapping to each end point to the corresponding R function. 

The OpenAPI definition of JAMES is at <https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/stefvanbuuren/james/1.5.4>. The API is currently frozen at version 1.5.4. The API is subject to change in future versions.

### Output formats

JAMES is built on top of the [**OpenCPU API**](https://www.opencpu.org/api.html), a powerful and flexible way for online deployment of R functionality. Although it is possible to use JAMES without knowledge of OpenCPU, it is useful to browse the OpenCPU features. 

OpenCPU offers multiple output formats out of the box. JAMES supports a subset of these through the `/{session}/{info}` end point. Here `session` is a special session code generated by OpenCPU that identifies the server location containing the results of a request. The output format `info` is one of the following:

| `{info}`   | Description                                    |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| `json`     | Function result as JSON                        |
| `print`    | Function result as formatted as print          |
| `csv`      | Function result as comma-separated format      |
| `tab`      | Function result as tab-delimited format        |
| `md`       | Function result as markdown format             |
| `svglite`  | Function result as SVG graph                   |
| `warnings` | Warnings from the R execution                  |
| `messages` | Messages, especially data validation info      |
| `console`  | Console print out, useful for locating errors  |
| `stdout`   | Standard output                                |
| `info`     | Overview of JAMES deployment                   |
| `parent`   | Parent directory of all OpenCPU session output |

In addition, the user can request the function result in a particular form. JAMES distinguishes the following groups of formats.

| Format group | Description                                                |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `dfm`        | Data format: `json`, `csv`, `tab`, `md`, `print`, `parent` |
| `ffm`        | Figure format: `svglite`, `print`, `parent`                |
| `sfm`        | System format:  `json`, `print`, `parent`                  |

In general, the user can specify the desired format by appending the format name to the URL. See <https://www.opencpu.org/api.html#api-formats> for examples.

### Objective

This document provides a quick introduction into the main JAMES features, and how these can be assessed from `R` and from the command line.


## Features 

### **`/version`**: Obtain version information

Let us first check whether JAMES is running. The following code makes a simple request to JAMES to see whether it is alive and to return the version number of the underlying `james` R package. We illustrate both requests in `R` and in `bash`.

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

We first need to install and load packages.

```{r httr, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("remotes", "httr", "jsonlite"))
remotes::install_github("growthcharts/jamesclient")
remotes::install_github("growthcharts/jamesdemodata")
remotes::install_github("growthcharts/bdsreader")
```
```{r load}
library(jamesclient)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```

Let's find out the JAMES version number. In this document, we define the server that hosts JAMES as follows.

```{r host}
# host <- "http://localhost"
host <- "https://james.groeidiagrammen.nl"
system(paste0("echo ", host, " > .host"))
```

We first illustrate a method that makes two requests to the server. The following commands call the `/version/json` end point in the JAMES API.

```{r versiontwostep}
r <- james_post(host = host, path = "version/json")
```

We added the `/json` to the pathname to extract the JSON representation of the result of the `R` function `james::version()`. The function result is an object of class `james_post` and consists of various components.

```{r}
names(r)
r$url
```

Most of the element are documented in the `response` object in the `httr` package. For example, we could use the call `httr::status_code(r)` to obtain the status code. The function `james_post()` adds the last five elements:

- `r$request_path` echoes the endpoint, here `/version/json`;
- `r$parsed` is a parsed version of the element `r$content`. Here it is a list of elements like names of the package, its date, and so on. In case of an error of the server function, we find the error message here;
- `r$warnings` contain any warnings thrown during execution;
- `r$messages` contain any messages, e.g. data reading errors;
- `r$session` (like `r r$session`) is a unique session code.

The `jamesclient::james_post()` function wraps the basis workhorse `httr::POST()` that does the actual server request. For illustration, we may obtain equivalent content by the POST function directly.

```{r}
path <- "version/json"
url <- parse_url(host)
url <- modify_url(url, path = file.path(url$path, path), query = "auto_unbox=true")
r <- POST(url)
fromJSON(content(r, type = "text", encoding = "UTF-8"))
```

##### **bash**

We use the `curl` Linux command. If needed, on Ubuntu install `curl` as

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install curl
```

Letâ€™s find out the JAMES version number. We first illustrate a method that makes two requests to the server.

The following `bash` commands call the `/version` API end point

```{bash}
curl -sX 'GET' \
   $(cat .host)/version \
  -H 'accept: text/json'
  
curl -sX POST $(cat .host)/version > resp
```

The response to the request consists of a set of URLs created on the server, each of which contains details on the response. 

```{bash}
cat resp
```

The path element following `tmp/` is a unique session key. See <https://www.opencpu.org/api.html> for the interpretation of the OpenCPU API.

The next snippet constructs the URL of a JSON representation of the result and downloads the contents of the URL as a file `value1`.

```{bash}
curl -s $(cat .host)$(head -1 resp)/json?auto_unbox=true > value1
cat value1
```

The above sequence makes two requests to the server. The following code compacts both steps into one.

```{bash}
curl -sX POST $(cat .host)/version/json?auto_unbox=true > value2
cat value2
```

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
rm resp value1 value2
```

### **`/data/upload`**: Upload child data

JAMES understands data that conform to the [Basisdataset JGZ 4.0.1](https://www.ncj.nl/onderwerp/digitaal-dossier-jgz/bds-jgz-versiebeheer/) coded as JSON according to a [JSON schema](https://github.com/growthcharts/bdsreader/blob/master/inst/schemas/bds_v3.0.json). This section explains how we create, validate and upload child data to JAMES.

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

Let us assume that we have already have child data in `R` stored as a `data.frame` or `tibble`. Here we copy the longitudinal demo data `maria.json` from the `bdsreader` package into the working directory.

```{r}
success <- file.copy(system.file("examples/maria.json", package = "bdsreader"), 
                     "maria.json", overwrite = TRUE)
```

The contents of the file is `json` format, ready for upload:

          "Waarde": "305"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

There are four ways to upload the data to JAMES:

1. Upload the file `"maria.json"`;
2. Convert to a string and upload;
3. Convert to a JSON object and upload;
4. Read the JSON file from a URL.

The `/data/upload` API end point handles these cases as follows:

```{r}
# upload as file
fn <- "maria.json"
r1 <- james_post(host = host, path = "data/upload/json", txt = fn)
status_code(r1)

# upload as string
js <- read_json_js(fn)
r2 <- james_post(host = host, path = "data/upload/json", txt = js)
status_code(r2)

# upload as JSON object
jo <- read_json_jo(fn)
r3 <- james_post(host = host, path = "data/upload/json", txt = jo)
status_code(r3)

# upload as URL
url <- file.path(host, "ocpu/library/bdsreader/examples/maria.json")
r4 <- james_post(host = host, path = "data/upload/json", txt = url)
status_code(r4)
```

If the status is 201, the data are uploaded to JAMES and processed. For example, the processed data after file upload is available as an R data frame under element `r1$parsed`. 

```{r}
r1$parsed
```

The session details, including the uploaded data, will remain available for a limited time. After 30 minutes the session is wiped. The session key is your entrance to the resource within the 30-minute window. The key can be retrieved as `r1$session`. For example, to see the result of the file upload session in markdown use

```{r}
(session <- r1$session)
resp <- james_get(host = host, path = file.path(session, "md"))
cat(resp$parsed)
```

**Troubleshooting data upload**: JAMES executes checks on the conversion and ranges of the data. To gain efficiency, it does not automatically validate the input data against the specified JSON schema. JAMES writes diagnostic, sometimes cryptic, messages to the directory `{session}/messages` if it finds a problem. The user can rerun the data upload with two additional flags that request extra diagnostic output.

Example: Suppose we compromise the data by removing the required `"clientDetails"` and the optional `"nestedDetails"` sections. The mangled input data look like:

```
{"Format":"3.0","organisationCode":12345,"reference":"Maria's mangled data","clientMeasurements":[{"bdsNumber":235,"values":[{"date":"20181111","value":380},{"date":"20181211","value":435}]}]}
```

Everything appears normal if we read this data by the default:

```{r}
fn <- "maria-mangled.json"
r5 <- james_post(host = host, path = "data/upload/json", txt = fn)
r5$parsed
```

If we upload with the additional `validate = TRUE` flag, JAMES runs the validation of the uploaded JSON against the JSON schema:

```{r}
r6 <- james_post(host = host, path = "data/upload/json", txt = fn, validate = TRUE)
mess <- james_get(host = host, path = file.path(r6$session, "messages"))
cat(mess$parsed)
```

which now indicates that the required JSON element `"clientDetails"` is missing. 

We may drill down further by setting the `intermediate = TRUE` flag. This writes five JSON files that document the data flow into `{session}/files/{*}.json`.

For example, we can ask for the input data as read by JAMES by

```{r}
r7 <- james_post(host = host, path = "data/upload/json", txt = fn, validate = TRUE, intermediate = TRUE)
url <- file.path(host, r7$session, "files/input.json")
url
```

With `browseURL(url)` we may view the file contents in the browser. The `files` directory contains five JSON files:

1. `files/input.json`: the JSON input data;
2. `files/bds.json`: a data frame with info per BDS number;
3. `files/ddi.json`: result of recoding BDS into GSED item names;
4. `files/psn.json`: known fixed child covariates;
5. `files/xy.json`: time-varying variables.

Inspection of these files may uncover any problems with JAMES's understanding of the data. If needed, study the underlying R source code at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/growthcharts/bdsreader/master/R/read_bds.R>.

The `validate` and `intermediate` flag are useful for development and debugging. In production, we recommend leaving them at their default value (`FALSE`) and monitor any messages written to `{session}/messages`.

##### **bash**

We start from child data in the file `maria.json` that we wish to process with JAMES. For testing purposes, you may change the values, but keep the general structure intact. The following `curl` commands uploads the file and processes the data.

```{bash}
curl -sF 'txt=@maria.json' -D headers $(cat .host)/data/upload/json > content
head content
```

Alternatively, we may read the file into a JSON string, and upload as follows:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
JS=$(jq '.' maria.json | jq -sR '.')
curl -s $(cat .host)/data/upload/json -d "txt=$JS" > content
```

Finally, if the data are located at a URL, use

```{bash eval=FALSE}
URL=$(cat .host)/ocpu/library/bdsreader/examples/maria.json
curl -s $(cat .host)/data/upload/json -d "txt='$URL'" > content
```


```{bash echo=FALSE}
rm content headers
```

### **`/charts/draw`**: Draw child data on growth chart

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

Maria is a preterm born at 27 weeks of gestational age. We already uploaded her data. We may now plot her growth data on the A4 chart for preterms as follows:

```{r}
r5 <- james_post(host = host, 
                 path = "/charts/draw/svglite", 
                 session = r1$session,
                 chartcode = "PMAAN27", selector = "chartcode",
                 query = list(height = 29.7/2.54, width = 21/2.54))
writeLines(r5$parsed, con = filename_chart1)
```

```{r displaysvg1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Maria's growth plotted on preterm chart, 0-15 months"}
knitr::include_graphics(filename_chart1)
```

Alternatively, we may upload data for a new child Laura and plot the data in one step:

```{r}
fn <- system.file("extdata/bds_v3.0/smocc/Laura_S.json", package = "jamesdemodata")
r6 <- james_post(host = host,
                 path = "/charts/draw/svglite", txt = fn, 
                 chartcode = "NMBA", selector = "chartcode",
                 query = list(height = 29.7/2.54, width = 21/2.54))
writeLines(r6$parsed, con = filename_chart2)
```

For A4 sized charts, we recommend to generate the plot with query arguments `list(height = 29.7/2.54, width = 21/2.54)`, as illustrated above. If you want to change the chart's size in your HTML, use the `out.width` knitr chunk option, e.g. set `out.width="500px"`. This gives the following output.

```{r displaysvg2, echo=FALSE, out.width="500px", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Laura's growth plotted on chart for Dutch girls, 0-4 years"}
knitr::include_graphics(filename_chart2)
```

JAMES features a built-in prediction module based on curve matching. Suppose we want to predict Laura's height at the 3y9m when Laura is 2 years old. The following chart plots 25 matches to Laura as grey curves. The variation between the grey curves at age 3y9m indicates the likely variation in the prediction. The blue line indicates Laura's predicted height at age 3y9m. 

```{r}
r7 <- james_post(host = host, 
                 path = "/charts/draw/svglite", txt = fn, 
                 chartcode = "NMBH", dnr = "2-4",
                 lo = 2.0, hi = 3.75, nmatch = 25,
                 show_future = TRUE, show_realized = TRUE,
                 query = list(height = 18/2.54, width = 18/2.54))
writeLines(r7$parsed, con = filename_chart3)
```

For square charts, use query arguments `list(height = 18/2.54, width = 18/2.54)` to generate the plot. In order to get the same age units as the previous chart, calculate `out.width` as `500/21*18 = "429px"`.

```{r displaysvg3, echo=FALSE, out.width="429px", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Predict Laura's future height at the age of 3y9m."}
knitr::include_graphics(filename_chart3)
```

##### **bash**

Upload `maria.json` and draw the height data on the default chart to produce an SVG file. Specify the proper `width` and `height` query parameters.

```{bash}
curl -sX 'POST' $(cat .host)'/charts/draw/svglite?width=7.09&height=7.09' \
-H 'accept: image/*' \
-F 'txt=@maria.json;type=application/json' > maria1.svg
```

We need to set `chartcode` and `selector` parameters to choose a different chart.

```{bash}
curl -sX 'POST' $(cat .host)'/charts/draw/svglite?width=8.27&height=11.69' \
-H 'accept: image/*' \
-F "chartcode='PMAAN27'" \
-F "selector='chartcode'" \
-F 'txt=@maria.json;type=application/json' > maria2.svg
```

An alternative is to read the data from a URL, and use the `application/json` protocol to specify parameters.

```{bash}
curl -sX 'POST' \
$(cat .host)'/charts/draw/svglite?width=8.27&height=11.69' \
-H 'accept: image/*' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{

### **`/charts/list`**: List available growth charts

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

JAMES contains a wide variety of built-in growth charts. Each chart has a unique `chartcode`. A typical chart code looks like `NJAA`. We obtain the full list of chart codes as

```{r}
r <- james_post(host = host, path = "charts/list/json")
charts <- r$parsed
```

The `charts` object is a data frame with `r nrow(charts)` rows (charts) and the following variables:

```{r}
names(charts)
```

JAMES contains charts for various child populations. There are charts for Down syndrome (DS), Hindustan (HS), Moroccan (MA), Dutch (NL)), preterm (PT) and Turkish (TU) children living in the Netherlands and the WHO Growth Standards (WHOblue, WHOpink). These charts contain references for height (hgt), weight (wgt), head circumference (hdc), weight-for-height (wfh), body mass index (bmi) and D-score (dsc), as well as combined charts with multiple references on A4 format (front, back, -hdc). 

The most important index variables are `population` and `side`:

```{r}
with(charts, table(population, side))
```

The URL `{host}/site` (see below) displays the currently active chart code as a field in the left sidebar.

##### **bash**

Restrict the listing to the WHO references:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
curl -sX 'POST' \
$(cat .host)'/charts/list/json' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"chartgrp": "who"
}'
```

#### {-}

### **`/charts/validate`**: Validate chart codes

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

The `/charts/validate` end point attempt to find one or more user-specified chart codes. For example, the following cocde checkc five chart codes:

```{r}
r <- james_post(host = host, 
                path = "charts/validate/json", 
                chartcode = c("NMAW", "NJAb", "PJAAN23", "PJAAN25", "dummy"))
r$parsed
```

##### **bash**

Check five chart codes:

```{bash}
curl -sX 'POST' \
$(cat .host)'/charts/validate/json' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"chartcode": [
"NMAW",
"NJAB",
"PJAAN23",
"PJAAN25", 
"dummy"
]
}'
```

### **`/screeners/list`**: List available growth screeners

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

JAMES implements several screening algorithms. The `/screeners/list` end point provides detailed information on each of these.

```{r}
r <- james_post(host = host, path = "/screeners/list/json", 
                session = r1$session)
names(r$parsed)
with(r$parsed, table(yname, Categorie))
```

There are currently `r nrow(r$parsed)` different codes. Codes ending in `31`, e.g., `1031` or `2031` indicate normal growth, whereas code ending in `41`, `42` and so on, signal that - according to the guidelines - the child should be referred for further investigation. 

##### **bash**

We get the details for the guidelines for head circumference as

```{bash eval=FALSE}
curl -sX 'POST' \
$(cat .host)'/screeners/list/json' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"ynames": "hdc"}'
```

#### {-}


### **`/screeners/apply`**: Apply growth screeners to child data

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

The `/screeners/apply` end point applies standard screeners to the child data. Invoke the screeners by

```{r eval=TRUE}
r <- james_post(host = host, path = "/screeners/apply/json", 
                session = r1$session)
r$parsed
```

The procedure

1. calculates, per outcome, the intervals between the most recent measurement and all earlier measurements;
2. tests whether any of those intervals produces a signal according the screening algorithm;
3. reports the most recent non-standard signal that indicate abnormal growth.

In the example, all returned codes (1031, 2031, 3031) end in "31", which signals normal growth. The full table of return codes and messages can be obtained by the `/screeners/list` end point (see above).

There are several possibilities to visualise and integrate multiple evaluations per curve performed in step 2 into one advice. Before May 2023, JAMES returned an advice for each combination of time point and outcome, but that table presented a lot of output that was difficult to act one. Since May 2023, JAMES reports only one signal per curve.

##### **bash**

```{bash}
curl -sX 'POST' \
$(cat .host)'/screeners/apply/json' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
-F 'txt=@maria.json;type=application/json'
```

### **`/site`**: Request an empty site

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

The `/site` end point provides interactive site containing all charts, but without child data. This end point is primarily useful to obtain a quick overview of the available charts.

```{r eval=FALSE}
browseURL(file.path(host, "site"))
```

##### **bash**

#### {-}


### **`/site/request`**: Request personalised site

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

The `/site/request` end point creates an URL to a personalised, interactive site containing all charts. 

```{r}
r <- james_post(host = host, path = "/site/request/json", 
                sitehost = host, txt = js)
r$parsed
```

Run the command and paste the generated URL in the address field of your browser. The starting chart is chosen by JAMES and depends on the age of the child.

Alteratively, we may start from the `session` created by `/data/upload`: 

```{r}
r <- james_post(host = host, path = "/site/request/json", 
                sitehost = host, session = r1$session)
r$parsed
```

Run the command and paste the generated URL in the address field of your browser. The starting chart is chosen by JAMES and depends on the age of the child.

-d '{"sitehost": "'$(cat .host)'"}' 

##### **bash**

```{bash}
curl -sX 'POST' \
$(cat .host)'/site/request/json' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
-F "sitehost='$(cat .host)'" \
-F 'txt=@maria.json;type=application/json'
```

#### {-}

### **`/blend/request`**: Obtain a blend from multiple end points 

#### {.tabset}

##### **R**

The `/blend/request` end point returns the results of multiple end points, and thus functions as a one-stop shop. However, currently it does not support graphics output, so use `/{session}/{info}/svglite` or `/charts/draw/svglite` for the charts.

```{r}
fn <- system.file("extdata", "bds_v3.0", "smocc", "Laura_S.json",
                 package = "jamesdemodata", mustWork = TRUE)
r <- james_post(host = host, path = "/blend/request/json", 
                sitehost = host, txt = fn)
r$parsed
```


```{r cleanup, include=FALSE}
files <- c("laura.svg", "maria.json", "maria1.svg", "maria2.svg")
file.remove(files)
```


##### **bash**

```{bash}
curl -sX 'POST' \
$(cat .host)'/blend/request/json' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"txt": "'$(cat .host)'/ocpu/library/bdsreader/examples/Laura_S.json",
"sitehost": "'$(cat .host)'",
"blend": "standard"
}'
```
